# Knot.x Fragments Engine

# How does it works
It is a **Handler** that processes a request during HTTP Server request processing.
It operates on **Fragments** that are result of breaking request into smaller, independent parts.
Knot Engine processes Fragments using **Knots**, that are self-contained services that enriches 
and transform Fragments.
