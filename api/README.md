# Knot.x Fragment API
This repository contains API model for the Fragments.
A **Fragment** is a piece of any kind of document that can be processed independently (e.g. 
an HTML snippet that represents the shopping cart or a JSON containing person's bookshelf).

Originally it may came from breaking a bigger document into smaller pieces.
Fragment is not associated in any way with any particular format, so examples of the fragment may be:
- piece of HTML markup,
- piece of PDF file,
- piece of Office document (e.g. Word paragraph or Excel row),
- some (binary) part of an image.

Fragment is a Data Object and you can read more about it composition in the 
[Fragment Data Object docs](https://github.com/Knotx/knotx-fragments/blob/master/api/docs/asciidoc/dataobjects.adoc).
